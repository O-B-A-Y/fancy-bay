# Fancy Bay - OBAY's client

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Contribution Guide

All the commit messages must be following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guide for semantic purposes! Otherwise your commits will be rejected automatically by commit hook!

#### <a name="commit-header"></a>Commit Message Header

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  │       │             │
  │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │       │
  │       └─⫸ Commit Scope: Feature scopes
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|test|chore
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory, the `(<scope>)` field is optional.

##### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Adding commit that is not related to code (resolve conflicts, etc...)

##### Scope (Optional)

The scope should be the name of the feature's scope that you're developing, it is OPTIONAL so feel free to skip it if you want to be more generic!
